## TP 1 Notes

In exercise 1, we observed how we can create shapes using the parallelogram shape (which includes 4 triangles) in a 2D plane. Also, we learned about **culling** and how to avoid **culling** using double-sided triangles. We also interacted with the interface and how to make _state_ changes using it connected into the scene object.
In exercise 2, we apply the principles that we done in exercise 1 using two isosceles triangles.

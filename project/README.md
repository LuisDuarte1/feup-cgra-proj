### Instructions for Controlling the Bee
* `W` - Move the bee to the front
* `A` - Rotate the bee to the left
* `S` - Move the bee to the back
* `D` - Rotate the bee to the right
* `Space` - Move the bee up
* `F` - Prompts the bee to fly down to the nearest flower
* `P` - The bee collects the pollen from the flower and returns to the orignal height/position
* `O` - If the bee is flying and transporting pollen, it will return to the hive and deposit the pollen

### Additional Developments
* For the additional development, we implemented a parabola-shaped trajectory for the bee when it descends or ascends from a flower, as well as when it heads towards the hive.
